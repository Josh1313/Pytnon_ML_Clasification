"I worked on a project to predict if it would rain or not. In one part, I used the data as it was without making any adjustments. In the other part, I made the data more organized and tuned the model to make it better at predicting."

The key points are predicting rain, using data as it is, and improving the model. If you need more details or have further questions, feel free to ask.
